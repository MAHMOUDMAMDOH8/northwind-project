The aim of the project is to extract data from the database and create a data warehouse. The ETL method was implemented through SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services). An instance of SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services) is used to construct cubes to give a multi-dimensional view of data. Lastly, Power BI maintains interactive dashboards design and development.
